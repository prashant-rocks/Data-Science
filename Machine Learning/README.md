Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
