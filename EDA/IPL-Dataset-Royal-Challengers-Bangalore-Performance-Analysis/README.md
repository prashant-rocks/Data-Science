## What we are analyzing

 - Team : Royal Challengers Bangalore(RCB) has been constantly trying
   to make the mark in IPL but not performing as expected and this is
   where our umbrella problem comes.
   
  - We are going to use EDA on the IPL deliveries data to find out some
   important information so as to take out some visible issues to
   resolve
   
  We will consider both batting and bowling data analysis to improve
   the same. We will analyze over following:
   
- Top Run scorer
- Top Wicket Taker
- Batting Performance in First Inning
- Batting Performance in Second Inning
- Batsman Dismissal Type Analysis
- Bowling Performance in First Inning
- Bowling Performance in Second Inning
- Inning wise winning ratio


## Analysis and Improvements

- RCB has to retain many or fill the replacement of itâ€™s top performing players specially bowlers as they either have moved or quit

- We have seen that team batting performance while batting second is quite low as compared to batting first so team need to focus on strategies while chasing the target score and playing under pressure.

- Player out caught percentage is so high and so team need to think of playing while built the inning gradually and need to choose wisely which ball to hit over the ground.

- Bowlers performance while defending the total is low as compared to bowling first but its not that much rather issue is to retain their best bowlers.

- Last but not the least team winning percentage is quite high while batting first so choosing batting first should be priority and winning toss is crucial.
